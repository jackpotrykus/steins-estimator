# steins-estimator

This iPython notebook walks the reader through a classic implementation of the James-Stein shrinkage estimator: minimizing the total squared error loss across estimates of the end-of-season batting averages of 15 baseball players.

The original paper is available [here], and the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%E2%80%93Stein_estimator) offers a more complete explanation of the mathematical proof behind it. Nonetheless, the notebook offers a good empirical walkthrough/example of the generalized James-Stein estimator.
