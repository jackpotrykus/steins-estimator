# steins-estimator

This iPython notebook walks the reader through a classic implementation of the James-Stein shrinkage estimator: minimizing the total squared error loss across estimates of the end-of-season batting averages of 15 baseball players.

The original paper is available [here](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bsmsp/1200512173), and the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%E2%80%93Stein_estimator) offers a more complete explanation of the mathematical proof behind it. Nonetheless, the notebook offers a good empirical walkthrough/example of the generalized James-Stein estimator.


## Instructions

To run this, clone the repo, `cd` into it and run `jupyter notebook`. This will start up a Jupyter Notebook on `localhost:888` and open the browser for you where you can then run it yourself.
